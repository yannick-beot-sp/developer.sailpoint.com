Most events a service generates are of little value to clients, so services create event triggers, also known as web hooks, that allow clients to subscribe to specific events they are interested in.

Event triggers use less bandwidth, they do not affect your API rate limit, and they are as close as you can get to real-time. However, event triggers have downsides to consider. They must be accessible from the public internet so the trigger service knows where to send the notification, and they can be harder to configure and operate than APIs are."),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"how-to-get-started-with-event-triggers"},"How to Get Started With Event Triggers"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Event triggers require different setup and testing steps than APIs do, so you should follow each document to better understand event triggers and the necessary steps to configure one.
