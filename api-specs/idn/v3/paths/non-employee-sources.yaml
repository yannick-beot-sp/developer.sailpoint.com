  summary: List Non-Employee Sources
  description: >-
    This gets a list of non-employee sources. There are two contextual uses for
    the requested-for path parameter: 
      1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or
    she may request a list sources assigned to a particular account manager by
    passing in that manager's id.
      2. The current user is an account manager, in which case "me" should be
    provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a
    list of the sources that he or she owns.
