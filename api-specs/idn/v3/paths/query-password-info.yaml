    This API is used to query password related information. 
    
    A token with [API authority](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#client-credentials-grant-flow) 
    is required to call this API.  "API authority" refers to a token that only has the "client_credentials" 
    grant type, and therefore no user context. A [personal access token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#personal-access-tokens) 
    or a token generated with the [authorization_code](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#authorization-code-grant-flow) 
    grant type will **NOT** work on this endpoint, and a `403 Forbidden` response 
    will be returned.
