  summary: Delete Account
  description: >-
    Use this API to delete an account. 

    This endpoint submits an account delete task and returns the task ID. 

    This endpoint only deletes the account from IdentityNow, not the source itself, which can result in the account's returning with the next aggregation between the source and IdentityNow. 
    To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that you [disable accounts](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/disable-account) rather than delete them. This will also allow you to reenable the accounts in the future. 

    A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.
