  summary: Process a list of identityIds
  description: |
    You could use this endpoint to:
    1. Calculate identity attributes, including applying or running any rules or transforms (e.g. calculate Lifecycle State at a point-in-time it's expected to change).
    2. Evaluate role assignments, leading to assignment of new roles and removal of existing roles.
    3. Enforce provisioning for any assigned accesses that haven't been fulfilled (e.g. failure due to source health).
    4. Recalculate manager relationships.
    5. Potentially clean-up identity processing errors, assuming the error has been resolved.
    
    To learn more, refer to the [identity processing documentation](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html).
