  summary: Delete Access Profile(s)
  tags:
    - Access Profiles
  description: >-
    This API initiates a bulk deletion of one or more Access Profiles.


    By default, if any of the indicated Access Profiles are in use, no deletions will be performed and the **inUse**
    field of the response indicates the usages that must be removed first. If the request field **bestEffortOnly** is
    **true**, however, usages are reported in the **inUse** response field but all other indicated Access Profiles will
    be deleted.


    A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition,
    a SOURCE_SUBADMIN may only use this API to delete Access Profiles which are associated with Sources they are able
    to administer.
